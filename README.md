# Delay-Optimization-in-IoT-Networks-Using-NOMA-with-Scheduling-and-Power-Control
🔬 Major Project: Delay Optimization in IoT Networks Using NOMA
Duration: Jan 2025 – July 2025
Technology Used: MATLAB
Domain: Wireless Communication, IoT, NOMA
Project Type: Academic Major Project

📌 Project Overview
This project presents a MATLAB-based simulation for optimizing delay in massive IoT networks using Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). Unlike traditional OMA (Orthogonal Multiple Access), NOMA allows multiple users to transmit simultaneously by assigning different power levels — reducing delay and improving spectral efficiency.

🎯 Objectives
Implement user scheduling to minimize intra-group interference

Apply power control (SIF-based) to meet SINR requirements

Simulate and analyze per-user delay reduction over time

Visualize delay trends using graph outputs

⚙️ Core Components
Component	Description
NOMA Access	Enables simultaneous communication over shared channels using power control
User Scheduling	Greedy algorithm inspired by K-CUT to group users with low interference
SIF Power Control	Iterative algorithm assigning power to users to meet SINR thresholds
Delay Modeling	Exponential decay model simulating delay reduction per user

📊 Output Summary
✅ Delay vs Iteration graph for each user (6 users, 50 iterations)

✅ User grouping (low-interference assignment)

✅ Final power allocation printed via MATLAB console

✅ Successfully demonstrates delay optimization with real-world inspired models

🧠 Key Insights
“We reduce delay by first grouping users smartly so they don’t interfere, and then assigning power levels using SIF so each user has just the right strength. Together, this makes the system efficient and delay goes down automatically.”
